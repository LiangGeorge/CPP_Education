1. What is the problem in declaring Int main()? 

Int is spelled as "int" in this case. You must always remember that C++ is case-sensitive. 

2. Can comments be longer than one line?

Yes! Comments can be longer than one line as long as you use "/*" (denoting the start of a comment) and 
"*/" (denoting the end of a comment).
